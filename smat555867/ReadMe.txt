The way I intended this to work is that at first the user will go to the homepage where they can either register or login
to gain access to the dashborad. The homepage contain thumbnails where user can view unit details and lecture timetable.

After login (option located at the navigation bar), students will gain access to the dashboard.
Dashboard will show content depending upon roles.

Student can see unit enroll page, individual timetable page and tutorial allocation page

DC will have access to academic staff list (Master) page and the unit management page.
Inside the unit management page, the div are separated using titles about who can see what
content. DC can see DC Area only.

DC can add staff, edit staff details and can assign their roles.

UC can only see the unit management page. Inside that page, they can only see the UC Area content. 
UC will be able to allocate lecturers for any semester and campus and also can pick day and time for lecture class.
They can do the same for the tutorial and the only difference is here the UC needs to choose the class size. 
They can only select certain lecturer and tutor from the list.
The availability of lecturers and tutors are based on the roles given by DC. UC can also see the student list and can edit the list.  


Lecturer can gain access to the unit management page and can only see their working area. They can view and edit the student list

Tutors can gain access to the unit management page and can only see their working area. They will be able to only view the studennt list 

I have used a lot of modals especially in the unit management page.
